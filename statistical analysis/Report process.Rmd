## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



In this RMarkdown file we will report shorty our process and the results. 

For this Class exercise we chose a dataset from the European Social Survey. We perceived this dataset as very huge whith 6033 objects. On the website there is a map of all the european countrys presented. After discussing this map we slowly arrived to our research question. In this map we saw the northern countrys had a smaller depression rate than the southern. 
On this point to be able to analyse and test a possible hypothesis we chose 6 important variables to test: country, age, depression, household income and region. 

Our hypothesis was that there is a strong correlation between these variables and the countrys. 

We think that there are smaller differences in the correlation between these variables in the north of Europe because these states are more stable and show a higher rate of happiness and a lower rate of depression. However we further think that the countrys in the south of Europe show higher differences in the variables because they are very unstable, have a higher criminality rate and are poorer.

This leads to our research question: Do the northern European countries really have very small or even no differences in the variables compared to the southern countrys?

With the ANOVA testing (a t-test) we could analyse if our hypothesis was true or false.

Based on this plot that we created we saw a first sign that our hypothesis could be significant:

ggplot(gender2_by_area, aes(x = area, y = mean_variable, fill = gender2)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average depression in the two areas",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Mean depression") +
  theme_minimal()

Through this plot we could recognize that the differences in the variables were bigger in south of Europe.

Altough the interaction term was slightly less significant (p=0.05), through our ANOVA-Testing we saw that the area and gender were separately significant (p<0.001).

All in all most of the differences were significant (p<0.001) except the difference between North:Male - North:Female.

In conclusion we can proudly say that our hypothesis is supported!
